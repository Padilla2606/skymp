# Damage calculation and hit handling

When a local hit event occurs, client sends an OnHit packet to server.

It contains the following fields:
```c++
uint32_t aggressor = 0; // originating actor
bool isBashAttack = false;
bool isHitBlocked = false;
bool isPowerAttack = false;
bool isSneakAttack = false;
uint32_t projectile = 0;
uint32_t source = 0; // formId of weapon (or of bare hands)
uint32_t target = 0; // target actor
```

## Damage formula

There is an interface
[`IDamageFormula`](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp/blob/main/skymp5-server/cpp/server_guest_lib/formulas/IDamageFormula.h),
which allows calculating damage based on aggressor and target actors, as well as hit data.

By default, vanilla Skyrim damage formula is used (althrough it's not fully
implemented yet, see below):
[`TES5DamageFormula`](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp/blob/main/skymp5-server/cpp/server_guest_lib/formulas/TES5DamageFormula.cpp).
But abstract formula will allow custom server implementations to easily redefine
formula by something else.

### Implemented formula components

At the moment, `TES5DamageFormula` is not complete enough and only takes basic
values into account. If you notice something missing, consider creating an
issue if it's not present yet. If you have C++ knowledge, we would be glad to
see your [contributions](https://github.com/skyrim-multiplayer/skymp/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!

Incoming damage:
```
incomingDamage = isUnarmed ? raceUnarmedDamage : baseWeaponDamage;
```

Armor damage reduction:
```
armorRating = armorRating1 + armorRating2 + armorRating3 + ... + armorRatingN + magicArmorRating;
//fMaxArmorRating is [GMST:00037DEB], fArmorScalingFactor is [GMST:00021A72];
//fMaxArmorRating = 80 by default, fArmorScalingFactor = 0.12 by default
//magicArmorRating is sum of magnitudes of armors' enchantments with magic effect of damage resist
//armorSkillMultiplier approximates armor skill + perks (not simulated by the server),
//it defaults to 4.5 and can be changed via armorFormulaSettings.ratingMultiplier
armorRating *= armorSkillMultiplier;
//vanilla also adds a hidden rating of 25 per worn piece (+3% reduction at
//fArmorScalingFactor = 0.12). SkyMP has no displayed rating, so it is applied
//as armorFormulaSettings.hiddenPieceBonus percent per worn piece (3 by default,
//0 disables it)
damageReduction = std::min(armorRating * fArmorScalingFactor + hiddenPieceBonus * wornArmorPieces, fMaxArmorRating);
receivedDamage = incomingDamage * 0.01 * (100 - damageReduction);
```
